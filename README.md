# Hi, I'm Mebrahtom Kidane 👋

### Full-Stack Software Engineer | Software Systems Architect

I am a **Full-Stack Software Engineer** dedicated to engineering resilient, high-performance communication platforms. My work centers on the intersection of architectural integrity and UI fluidity, ensuring that complex systems remain reliable under load while providing a seamless user experience.

- 🔭 **Current Focus:** Refining distributed messaging architectures and custom build pipelines.
- ⚡ **Specialization:** TypeScript-driven development, ACID-compliant state management, and real-time synchronization.
- 🛠️ **Philosophy:** I believe in "Zero-Lag" interfaces and "All-or-Nothing" data integrity. If it isn't resilient, it isn't finished.

## 🚀 Featured Project: [SemayChat](https://github.com/mebrahtomkg/SemayChat)
**A high-performance, self-hosted messaging platform engineered for privacy and reliability.**

SemayChat isn't just a chat app; it's a study in robust systems architecture. It handles the complexities of real-time data, media processing, and network instability through custom-engineered solutions.

### 🏗️ Architectural Highlights
*   **Queue-Based Message Delivery:** Decouples UI actions from API calls using a global Zustand-based FIFO queue, ensuring 100% message delivery even during network transitions.
*   **ACID-Compliant Transactions:** Implements strict Sequelize-managed transactions with Row-Level Locking to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency.
*   **Custom Rspack Build Pipeline:** Features a bespoke plugin (`AppRspackPlugin`) for Service Worker orchestration, enabling high-performance media caching without HMR conflicts.
*   **Zero-Lag Theming:** A CSS-variable-driven architecture that bypasses React reconciliation for instantaneous theme switching.
*   **Touch-Optimized UX:** A custom-built, off-screen canvas cropping system with pinch-to-zoom support for mobile-first profile management.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

> *"Software is only as strong as its weakest failure mode."*

My approach to development is defined by three core pillars:

1.  **Type Safety as a Foundation:** With a codebase exceeding 500 files, I utilize TypeScript (98% coverage) to ensure data structures remain consistent from the database layer to the final UI component.
2.  **Resource Integrity:** I implement "Two-Phase Resource Cleanup" strategies—deferring physical file deletion until database transactions are confirmed—to prevent "ghost" files and orphaned data.
3.  **Performance via Abstraction:** I prefer custom-built, lightweight logic (like my Declarative Lifecycle Animation Engine) over heavy external libraries to maintain a minimal memory footprint and maximum execution speed.
